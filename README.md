Project Title

WiPark is designed to bring an IoT solution to many students parking issues at their university. The primary goal of this system is to present the user with real-time parking lot information so that they won’t need to waste time searching each lot for parking. Our vision for the “WiPark” is to eventually be utilized campus wide at universities across the nation.
